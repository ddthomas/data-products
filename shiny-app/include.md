### Welcome to the storm database explorer - economic impact edition.

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

The data is a [NOAA dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) from the JHU/Coursera Reproducible Research Course which was used in the week 4 assignment. The original assignment is available for viewing on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/ddthomas/495147).

### Using the data product

Navigating between tabs at the top gives you a chance to switch between economic impacts on states and on the nation. 

In both cases the panel on the left side allows you to filter for type of severe weather event that you are interested in. 

You can adjust date range and event types using control panel located on the left side. 

The filtered dataset can be downloaded using the data tab.

Note that while the data starts at 1950, the slider selecting year is preset to start at 1996 because that was the first year to track all severe weather types. Previous years were limited to a subset.
